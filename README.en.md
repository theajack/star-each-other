## ðŸš€ Github Mutual Helper Alliance

Designed to help developers accumulate the initial number of stars in their warehouses

### Original intention

The exposure of good projects is not enough, the number of stars is scarce, and niche project developers can support each other â€™s stars to accumulate a certain number of initial stars, so that the chance of obtaining official recommendations or other exposures will increase

When the number of initial stars increases, the probability of getting a new star also increases

However, the existing QQ and WeChat group mutual assistance methods are not ideal, the messages are messy, and the operation is cumbersome, so a star-each-other warehouse is established

### Principle

1. Integrity and mutual assistance, never cancel star
2. After star, please leave your own warehouse address in issue, in line with the principle of good faith and mutual assistance, please take the time to return to star after receiving the notice

### Proposal

Under the project [new issue] (https://github.com/theajack/star-each-other/issues/new), leave the project address you want to be star!

Leave a message to someone's issue star after leaving a warehouse address you want to be star
